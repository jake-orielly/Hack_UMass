# Hack_UMass
UMass Hackathon Project
Collaboration between Joseph O'Rielly and Daoxu Ye
goals: Difficult but thoughtful
Mix of hard timing and difficult puzzles?
1. You have a set (maybe destroyable) set of blocks at the middle tower format? 
2. Blocks come targetted at you, move at different speeds. 
3. Spawn rate increases as time passes

Can't go through platforms/enemies in any way, shape, or form
Only ways to die are by hitting the bottom or a spike. (Requires a reset button)
Jump has a max time (1 second? 0.5 second?). If jump key hasn't been released, gravity starts then
Potential double jump? (Counter for jump = 1. Set to 0 if jump is released then pressed again) 
Blocks come flying at you (more and more later on). Same collision as platforms/enemies.
Block direction is based on spawn point and where you were when it spawned.
Point counter equal to number of blocks that have spawned so far
