# Hack_UMass
UMass Hackathon Project
Collaboration between Joseph O'Rielly and Daoxu Ye
goals: Difficult but thoughtful
Mix of hard timing and difficult puzzles?
1. You have a set (maybe destroyable) set of blocks at the middle tower format? 
2. Blocks come targetted at you, move at different speeds. 
3. Spawn rate increases as time passes
